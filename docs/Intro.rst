Documentation on statistics to evaluate the sensitivity of atrophy detection with SCT. Average CSA of each image is indexed as :math:`CSA(sI, rX, tY)` where:

- :math:`(sI)` corresponds to subject :math:`I`
- :math:`(rX)` corresponds to the applied scaling factor :math:`X` on the native image (e.g. X=1, X=0.95, X=0.8)
- :math:`(tY)` corresponds to the applied random affine transformation Y on the native image
