STATISTICS
============
Statistics documentation to evaluate the sensitivity of atrophy detection with SCT. Each image CSA is indexed as follows: :math:`CSA(sI, rX, tY)` where

- :math:`(sI)` corresponds to subject :math:`I`
- :math:`(rX)` corresponds to the applied rescaling :math:`X` on the native image (e.g. 1, 0.95, 0.8)
- :math:`(tY)` corresponds to the applied random affine transformation Y on the native image
